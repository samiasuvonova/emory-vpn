The Emory VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an essential service that provides secure, encrypted access to the Emory University network from any off-campus location. This powerful tool acts as a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, making it appear as if your computer is physically connected to the campus network. For students, faculty, and staff, using the Emory VPN is the primary method for accessing restricted university resources, applications, and data when working or studying remotely. It is a fundamental component of modern academic and professional life at Emory, ensuring both productivity and data security regardless of your physical location.



To establish a connection, the university utilizes the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client, a reliable and widely-used software solution. A critical aspect of the Emory VPN service is its integration with Duo two-factor authentication. This mandatory security layer provides an essential safeguard by requiring a second form of verification from your mobile device or token after you enter your standard Emory NetID and password. This process ensures that only authorized individuals can access the network, protecting both your personal information and sensitive university data from unauthorized access and potential cyber threats.



Once successfully connected to the Emory VPN, users gain seamless off-campus access to a wide range of protected services that are otherwise unavailable. This access is crucial for research, administrative tasks, and coursework. Key resources available through the VPN include:




Full access to Emory Libraries' electronic journals, articles, and databases.


Connection to departmental and personal network drives (such as P: and T: drives).


Access to specific administrative systems like OPUS, Compass, and other internal Emory web applications.


The ability to use certain software licenses that are restricted to the campus network.





Getting started with the service is a straightforward process managed by Emory's Office of Information Technology (OIT). The official Cisco AnyConnect client can be downloaded directly from the OIT software distribution website. The installation is guided by clear instructions for all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Should you encounter any issues with installation or connection, the Emory OIT Service Desk provides comprehensive support and troubleshooting documentation to help you resolve problems quickly and maintain your secure connection to Emory network resources.
